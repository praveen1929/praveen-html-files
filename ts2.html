        <p>First paragraph.Writing a book or book chapter is different from an article because the author has more opportunity, with more pages allowed, to provide background information and discuss related content than in a manuscript for a journal. Writing a book requires time and commitment. An early consideration is whether the author or coauthors will write all of the chapters themselves or if the book will be a contributed text. In a contributed book, authors or coauthors write individual chapters under the guidance of an editor who assembles those chapters into a book. Authors with known expertise may be asked by a publisher to write a book. Usually, the acquisitions editor contacts the author to inquire about the authorâ€™s interest. The publisher is responsible for getting the book into production, copyediting the manuscript, designing the book, carrying out other details to produce it, and marketing it.</p>

        <p>Second paragraphSometimes researchers decide to publish their work in a book chapter in
            an edited volume, or they may decide to write a monograph or another type of book. There are advantages and disadvantages in choosing to publish in book form. This section discusses the merits of publishingbook chapters and books with a section on writing monographs basedon PhD theses.</p>
        <p>Third paragraph.Despite being the primary site of scholarly conversation in the sciences, not all disciplines revolve around the journal literature. Often considered "book-based" disciplines include archeology, law, politics/international studies, psychology, philosophy, sociology, history, communications, and media studies. Book chapters are generally cited less than journal articles and there isn't as established of a culture of research impact measurement around book chapters as there is around journal articles. Book chapters are still valuable pieces of academic writing, however, as they provide a home to content that doesn't fit well into the article format. Finding book chapters using electronic resources can be a little bit tricky, as the tools are scattered, but read on for specific tips, tricks, and resources to try out. </p>
